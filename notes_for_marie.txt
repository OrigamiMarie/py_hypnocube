Just a silly little file of notes to self.  Mostly things that are probably really obvious to anybody with experience in python and publishing packages.  


Various useful Python package publishing info here:  https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/distributing.html


Best way to check out a python package
(make sure pip is install)
(make sure virtualenv is installed by doing pip install virtualenv (possibly with sudo))
make a directory
virtualenv <DIR>
source <DIR>/bin/activate
git clone <package>
cd <package_directory>
pip install -e .



Pushing the package to pypi
python setup.py bdist_wheel
(make sure the ~/.pypirc file that is on the packaging.python.org page exists)
twine upload dist/*
